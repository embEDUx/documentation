## Getting started 

After [installing](setup/flashtool/README.md) the **flashtool** on a linux system it
has to be configured first. To do so, type in the following command:

> `flashtool init`

The tool needs a *working directory* which is set at the home directory
by default. (***${HOME}/.flashtool***) It can be set by the user with the option
*-w | --working-dir*.

> `flashtool -w /path/to/own/working_dir`
