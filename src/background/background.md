## The Beginning
The name **embEDUx** includes hints for the words *embedded linux* and
*education*. The goal to deliver an environment that eases the effort of creating various
embedded linux distributions depending on the educational purpose that they are
specifically aiming for. 

The idea has its origin at the IT-faculty at the HTWG Constance, where embEDUx will
have the use-case of preparing and maintaining linux distributions for the
different lab-courses taken by students. All of these lab-courses evolve around
the linux operating system, software applications for linux and hardware
components that are capable of running linux. Over time, the diversity in soft-
and hardware utilized in these lab-courses has increased and so has the
complexity and effort to prepare and maintain the systems in use.  

The embEDUx project has been created to find a generic and automated approach
for tasks concerning the preparation of soft- and hardware for these lab-courses
offered at the HTWG, which is the reason why the embEDUx requirements will have
a strong bias towards the requirements specific to the lab-courses.

## Initial contributors
The project started off with three master students of computer science working
on a team-project, supervised by a professor. Namely, these are

* Prof. Dr. Michael MÃ¤chtel
* Lars Eckervogt
* Manuel Hieke 
* Stefan Junker
