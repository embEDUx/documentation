### Comparable RootFS buildsystems
The software that is used to assemble the RootFS according to the provided
package list must be chosen wisely. There are many projects to consider for this
part. The following of them will be evaluated:

* Yocto Project
* Buildroot
* Gentoo crossdev
* Gentoo catalyst

Because **embEDUx** is mainly targeted at ARM systems, the main evaluation
criteria is cross-platform support.
