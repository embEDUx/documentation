## Requirements

## Buildbot buildmaster Webinterface
The *buildmaster* provides a webinterface that can be used to control and
monitor the buildmaster's behavior.

### Waterfall
The **buildbot** waterfall-view gives an overview over all running and recent
builds in one place. Colors indicate the state of the builds and links to
detailed logs or general build information are provided.
