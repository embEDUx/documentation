# Troubleshooting
This page gives an overview about how to get to the source of failing builds.

## Build Debugging
The complex architecture of **embEDUx** makes it more difficult to debug the
actual build process. Therefore the following points will give some hints on how
to still be able to debug the build process.

### Linux/Uboot/Misc/Toolchain
* [Local Testing](local-testing.md)
* [Entering the build environment](entering-build-environment.md)

### RootFS
* [Manually enter a RootFS Build
  Environment](rootfs/entering-build-environment.md)
* [Monitoring Package Installation](rootfs/monitoring-package-installation.md)
