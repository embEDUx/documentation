# Repository Setup
**(work in progress)**

## Backend Repositories
The buildserver needs these two repositories in order to operate. They must be
cloned from the repositories found on [GitHub](TODO).

### Buildserver Setup
### RootFS Buildroutine


## Product Repositories
Setup an empty repository for each of the products. They will be used by the
users to provide their build specifications to the buildserver.
