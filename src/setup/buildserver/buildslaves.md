# Preparing the Buildslaves
Depending on the supported architecture in your setup, you have several
buildslaves. They are specified in the parameters of the [buildserver setuproutine](../buildserver.md), and are automatically installed during its execution.

For more background details, please see [the buildslaves background page](../../background/buildslaves.md)
